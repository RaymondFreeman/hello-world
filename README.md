# hello-world
getting started
I am Raymond. I am new to coding. But I had taken basic programming(java) course in university. And I know that I am talented in this field and I can enjoy it.
Here my goal is to be a master in blockchain web/app development to earn my life.  
I think this(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ&t=5447) video is qulified and up-to-date source to get started. I try to follow instructions.
Above all, I believe in myself.
